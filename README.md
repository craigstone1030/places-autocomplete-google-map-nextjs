This project is about **react google map and places autocomplete**. Many of us faced problems using react google map and places autocomplete components together or don't know how to use them without any warning. In this project, I have used them in a simple way and without any errors. I have used **[@react-google-maps/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-google-maps/api)** package for google map and places autocomplete. 

**Technology:**

 - Next.js
 - React.js
 - Bootstrap 5
